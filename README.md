## Welcome to CNPD: The Crustacean Neuropeptide Database

**Neuropeptides** are critical signaling molecules involved in numerous physiological processes, including **metabolism, reproduction, development, and behavior**. In **crustaceans**, neuropeptides regulate key biological functions such as **molting, feeding, and immune responses**. Despite their significance, **crustacean neuropeptides** remain **underrepresented** in existing neuropeptide databases.

To address this gap, we introduce **The Crustacean Neuropeptide Database (CNPD)** â€“ A **comprehensive resource** for neuropeptide research in crustacean species. **CNPD** systematically curates **experimentally confirmed and predicted neuropeptides** from various **crustacean species** using **Peer-reviewed literature**, **Mass spectrometry-based peptidomics**, and **Public protein databases**

This database provides **detailed annotations** to support **Comparative neurobiology** , **Functional studies**, and **Computational peptide discovery**
